# Sales-Region-

1.Overview


The Regional Sales Analysis project uses Excel, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance across different regions. The goal is to identify trends, top-performing areas, and improvement opportunities. The workflow starts with raw sales data in Excel, processes and cleans it using Python, and finally visualizes it through interactive Power BI dashboards.

Top Revenue Regions: North-West and South-East regions consistently generated the highest revenue.


Low-Performing Regions: The Central region recorded the lowest sales and profit margins, indicating a need for targeted sales strategies.


Seasonal Trends: Sales peaked during January and December, suggesting strong year-end demand.


Profitability Patterns: Some high-sales regions had low profit margins due to high operational costs.


Product Performance: Product E and Product C were the top revenue generators, especially in wholesale channels.


Payment Mode Preference: Most customers preferred digital payments over cash in all regions.


10.Conclusion & Recommendations


Focus marketing efforts in high-performing regions to maximize profit.
